# NetShield


Repository for Morgan Trainor's final year project: NetShield


Supervisor: Rory Hopcraft




Project Vision
NetShield will be a software solution to a common problem. Itâ€™s a catch-all program targeted at users with diverse technical backgrounds that aims to identify and target common vulnerabilities in home networks. It will provide a comprehensive view of each discoverable device connected to the network and look for things such as open ports and common passwords that can pose a security risk and guide the user on how to fix these issues.


With the ever-evolving world of technology we have created increased groups of people are interacting with new devices, with various levels of technological literacy and cyber security knowledge. We must protect all of our online assets and even simple housekeeping measures can ensure device security against many threats.
UI (User Interface) design is particularly important in relation to ease of use for non-superusers. However, the UX (User Experience) encompasses how good the software experience is for the user. I wanted to do research into apps that are successful and have a good user experience vs less successful and poor design.
This project is being made to educate and help non-technical users about good cyber-security with a focus on a clean, smooth operating user experience.
