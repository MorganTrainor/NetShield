Repository for Morgan Trainor's final year project: NetShield


Supervisor: Rory Hopcraft




Project Vision
NetShield will be a software solution to a common problem. Itâ€™s a catch-all program targeted at users with diverse technical backgrounds that aims to identify and target common vulnerabilities in home networks. It will provide a comprehensive view of each discoverable device connected to the network and look for things such as open ports and common passwords that can pose a security risk and guide the user on how to fix these issues.


NetShield aims to educate users about potential risks and be a non-intrusive solution to the common weaknesses often found within home networks and foster a safer digital environment for everyone.
